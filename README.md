this is a demo fo a Web Api built in net core 2.2 to submit feedback form the players and then retrieve the feedback list, allowing to filter by rate.

the database was LiteDB embedded, a mongo like database but without the necessity to install the whole server in the machine, just run and fun!

please review the wiki for more details about how to run it, desgin or any other information about the project.
